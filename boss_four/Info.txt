witch_throw:
It currently has 18 frames and each frame is 320X320. It does not shoot any projectiles since I dont know 
if should animate projectiles or leave them as a png. 
I also need to come up for concecpts for the projectiles.

witch_punch:
34 frames and each frame is 320X320. I didnt implement the fumes because I dont know what the right range should be. 
The fumes would also not be able to fit in witch_punch since its constricted by a 32 byt 32 frame window. I would have to make another file called fumes.png. I plan to do so in the future.

witch_walk:
28 frames and each frame is 320X320. It only walks for a moment and sits back down to attack or throw magic and then gets back up. 

witch_broom:
5 frames and each frame is 320X320

magic:
It is a projectile for the witch but it starts from the lower left corner and ends on the top right corner.
